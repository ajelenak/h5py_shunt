# h5py_switch

Working with HDF5 data stored either in files or in the cloud requires using two packages: `h5py` and `h5pyd`. `h5py_switch` provides a unified interface that seamlessly switches between these two packages based on the HDF5 data's location.

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install git+https://github.com/ajelenak/h5py_switch.git
```

`h5py` and `h5pyd` will also be installed.
